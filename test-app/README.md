# Classic minesweeper game

Little project of minesweeper game to practice on my React and Node.js skills.

## Upcoming features

Things I'll be working on this project, wich will mainly be a sandbox for me...

### `Playable minesweeper`

Pretty obvious...

### `Multiple difficulty levels`

The player will be able to select a level of difficulty for the game, defining how many mines will be on the grid.

### `Multiple sizes of grid`

A bit similar to the difficulty levels, the player will be able to choose the size of the grid to play on. Small, medium, large...

### `Points calculation`

The game will be timed, and a number of points will be given for completing a grid. The calculation of points is still to be defined.

### `Game save`

Might be the first thing that will really need a back end, players will be able to save their game if they want to finish it another time.

### `High scores`

Display a table of high scores

**I'll update this file as ideas come to my mind, for as many features as my patience on this project will hold...**
